## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a frontend developer with three years of experience in this field. During this time, I not only actively studied various aspects of frontend development, but also applied the knowledge I gained in practice, which allowed me to better understand the specifics of the work. I have always been interested in creating user-friendly, beautiful and functional interfaces that make user interaction with the product as comfortable as possible. I am currently working at Ingate, where I am developing professionally and striving to continuously improve my skills. I am sure that frontend is not just a job for me, but a real vocation that motivates me to move forward and master new technologies.
